        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My College Life here in University
            of San Carlos was <b> very challenging, yet harmonious. </b>
            Being a Carolinian for <b> me is a Gift and pleasure. </b> I can say that I am very lucky to have a
            School like this, in reality my family can’t send me here in USC due to some financial
            problems, but because of Passerelles Numeriques NGO I was able to enter here in very
            prestigious University and it is one of the best Schools here in the Philippines.
            <b> Being a Scholar of PN </b> was a stepping stone for me. I will climb some steep mountains,
            run a mile ahead, but it was a key for me to defeat all the barriers that serve as the
            challenges and difficulties for me to taste the sweet fruit of success. Success that would
            serve as my accomplishment in life to withstand all of those struggles. <b>And a Carolinian
                was my best asset in life and I would treasure it my whole life, </b> because I am <b> very lucky
                enough to have School like this. </b>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was taking up a Certificate in
            Computer Technology, it is a Passerelles Numeriques
            own curriculum for their scholars. Having a Course of Computer Technology in the field
            of Information Technology <b> dealing with different kinds of programming languages, codes,
                and syntaxes for me was a great experience, </b> because at first I thought IT don’t have
            any mathematics involved, indeed it has a lot you need to have a logic in this course.
            But it was a <b> very interesting and very nice course </b> that I am taking up right now. <b> I found
                out that I gained a lot of knowledge and lessons in this Field. </b>

        </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preview I experienced here in
            USC was really a memorable and unforgettable one.
            <b> Entering with a very big Campus, </b> having air conditioned classrooms and laboratories,
            having <b> great teachers </b> who handled our different types of curriculum, experiencing
            <b> rides in shuttles </b> that other Universities don’t have, <b> playing basketball </b> with the
            regular students during vacant time and the best was having a chance to <b> enter in the
                MR HALL </b> in this School, thus it is one of the best facility USC had . And also I used
            to explore programs, meet faculty, and tour facilities at USC. <b> Intramurals is one of
                my memorable moments I experienced, </b> meeting some Carolinians from different departments
            and different Campuses. Another wonderful event I joined in USC was <b> the USC Affinity,
                USC days and the USC Fun Run. </b> Also the Information about student organizations, helpful
            resources, and academic programs that match student interests.
